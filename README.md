# zybooks-mcq

Script to bruteforce Zybooks multiple choice questions.

## Why?

Because Zybooks is fucking awful. Could you believe I had to pay $55 for this? I
had to pay $55 to learn something that takes me minutes to learn. It already
takes me a minute to complete each lab assignment; why would I want to bother
going through all these? To top it off, I have to pay full tuition for online
classes. What? Why? What is wrong with this world? How is it this bad? Where did
we go so wrong? AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA

## Usage

1. Install the script, preferably using ViolentMonkey.
2. Go to the Zybooks.
3. Ctrl+Shift+C.
4. `await window.doMCQ()`.
5. Optionally do `await window.doShortAnswers()`.
